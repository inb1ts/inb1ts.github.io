The purpose of the tool is to help facilitate blending in with common browser traffic, which will usually include frequent requests for CSS files that the browser will then use to format the layout of a webpage. For example, here are all the CSS files requested when loading a youtube video:\nHow it works For those unfamiliar with CSS, it is a stylesheet language used to style HTML elements. A CSS file will usually contain multiple “rulesets”, which consist of a selector that matches a HTML element name, some properties, and values for those properties. The following image taken from Mozilla docs shows what a very basic ruleset might look like:\nThese rulesets are parsed by the browser, after which the styles are applied to DOM nodes (a representation of the document in-memory that the HTML has been converted to).\nThe example in the image above uses a colour property - there are multiple ways of representing colour property values in CSS, but two formats in particular are useful for us wanting to encode parts of our payload:\nRGB values: rgb(152 42 87) Hex values: #ffb71d Each value can hold 3 bytes of information that correspond to Red/Green/Blue (rgb also can include a fourth byte for an Alpha value, but the tool currently isn’t utilising this). CSSHide works by splitting a payload into 3-byte chunks and formatting those bytes into the colour values.\nOnce we’ve translated our payload into a list of these colour values, the tool generates a CSS file that incorporates them. It starts by creating a short block of CSS variables, which is a quick way of legitimately using many colours in quick succession. Then after the variable section, the remaining colour values are placed in CSS blocks that use a selector randomly picked from a list of generic CSS class selectors that are included in the project.\nBy default the output is then minified, a process used to save space by removing any whitespace from the file that doesn’t impact the CSS property values. The minifying can be disabled with a flag if desired. Some examples of the different output styles are included in the github readme.\nThe tool is best suited to smaller payloads, as typically CSS files aren’t too big. Larger payloads still work (as per the demo below), but defeat the purpose of the obfuscation by producing a suspiciously large CSS file.\nhttps://github.com/inb1ts/CSSHide\nDemo ","wordCount":"452","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Castro.jpg%3E","datePublished":"2023-09-05T15:58:43+01:00","dateModified":"2023-09-05T15:58:43+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tom Brice"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/new-tool-csshide/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Inbits Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Inbits Blog (Alt + H)">Inbits Blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
