      <title>EDR Unhooking: Patching Falcon hooks without VirtualProtect</title>

      <description>I recently encountered a blog post by Signal Labs about using in-memory disassembly to perform EDR unhooking. In the post, the authors outline a technique whereby hook jumps implemented by Sophos are followed in order to find the relocated original syscall stub. This is first done for NtAllocateVirtualMemory, which the authors unhook by replacing the EDR&amp;rsquo;s hook with their own hook pointing to the relocated stub. Once they&amp;rsquo;ve unhooked this function, it can be leveraged for the further unhooking of other functions.</description>

      <description>It’s almost a bit of a cliché after passing the OSCP to do a writeup about the journey it took to get there - but I’m embracing the cliché for two reasons:
When I was preparing I encountered tips and suggestions in blog posts that had a huge impact on the rest of my preparation. Approaching the OSCP with experience as a Programmer/Software Engineer can result in slightly different prioritisation during preparation, and anecdotally it’s touched on in fewer guides because it’s not the common path.</description>
