      <title>New Tool: CSSHide - Hiding in plain style</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working on a small fun obfuscation tool called CSSHide, which can encode a payload in the colour values of a CSS file. This was inspired by the payload encoding modules featured at Maldev Academy, that include encoding payloads as IP addresses, UUIDs, and MAC addresses.
Why CSS files? The purpose of the tool is to help facilitate blending in with common browser traffic, which will usually include frequent requests for CSS files that the browser will then use to format the layout of a webpage.</description>

      <title>OpenFileMapping and KnownDlls</title>

      <description>A common method of unhooking user-land API hooks is to load a fresh copy of NTDLL from KnownDlls, a special object directory that&amp;rsquo;s used to essentially cache commonly used system DLLs. We can use WinObj to view the Object Manager namespace, where we can see the KnownDlls directory, and the mapped sections it contains for each system DLL.
Whilst working through the excellent Maldev Academy course material, it was pointed out that you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to use OpenFileMapping to retrieve a handle to the KnownDlls directory, despite it&amp;rsquo;s purpose being to open named file mapping objects.</description>

      <title>EDR Unhooking: Patching Falcon hooks without VirtualProtect</title>
      <link>https://inbits-sec.com/posts/in-memory-unhooking/</link>

      <description>I recently encountered a blog post by Signal Labs about using in-memory disassembly to perform EDR unhooking. In the post, the authors outline a technique whereby hook jumps implemented by Sophos are followed in order to find the relocated original syscall stub. This is first done for NtAllocateVirtualMemory, which the authors unhook by replacing the EDR&amp;rsquo;s hook with their own hook pointing to the relocated stub. Once they&amp;rsquo;ve unhooked this function, it can be leveraged for the further unhooking of other functions.</description>

      <title>My OSCP Preparation Tips</title>
      <link>https://inbits-sec.com/posts/oscp-prep-tips/</link>

      <description>It’s almost a bit of a cliché after passing the OSCP to do a writeup about the journey it took to get there - but I’m embracing the cliché for two reasons:
When I was preparing I encountered tips and suggestions in blog posts that had a huge impact on the rest of my preparation. Approaching the OSCP with experience as a Programmer/Software Engineer can result in slightly different prioritisation during preparation, and anecdotally it’s touched on in fewer guides because it’s not the common path.</description>
